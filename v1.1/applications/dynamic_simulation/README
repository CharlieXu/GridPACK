The dynamic simulation applications needs additional parameters that are not
supported by the standard PTI version 23 format. To run the dynamic simulation,
the following 6 parameters must be added to each GENERATOR line (the standard
GENERATOR lines contain 18 parameters).

GENERATOR REACTANCE
GENERATOR RESISTANCE
GENERATOR TRANSIENT REACTANCE
GENERATOR SUBTRANSIENT REACTANCE
GENERATOR INERTIA CONSTANT H
GENERATOR DAMPING COEFFICIENT 0

All of the parameters are real numbers
