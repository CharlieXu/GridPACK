/// A solver for system(s) of linear equations in parallel
/**
 * A LinearSolver is used to solve a system of linear equations:
 * \f[
 *   \left[ \mathbf{A} \right] \mathbf{x} ~ = ~ \mathbf{b}
 * \f]
 * where \f$\left[ \mathbf{A} \right]\f$ is the coefficient matrix,
 * and \f$\mathbf{x}\f$ and \f$\mathbf{b}\f$ are vectors.
 *
 * A LinearSolver is instantiated using an existing coefficient
 * Matrix.  It must be intantiated simutaneously on all processes
 * involved in the \ref parallel::Communicator "communicator" used by
 * the coefficent Matrix. It similarly must be destroyed
 * simultaneously on all processes.
 *
 * A particular system is solved using the solve() method, which
 * requires the \f$\mathbf{b}\f$ Vector and a Vector that serves as
 * the intial estimate of \f$\mathbf{x}\f$. Multiple systems can be
 * solved using the same coefficient matrix by repeatedly calling
 * solve() with different \f$\mathbf{b}\f$ and \f$\mathbf{x}\f$
 * vectors.  If the coefficient matrix changes in any way (even just
 * the coefficients) between system solutions, the setMatrix() method
 * must be called before solve();
 * 
 * This class encapuslates the linear system solver of the underlying
 * math library. The Pimpl idiom is used for \ref
 * LinearSolverImplementation "implementation", so user code is
 * completely independent of the underlying library. This class simply
 * provides an interface to a specific \ref LinearSolverImplementation
 * "implementation".
