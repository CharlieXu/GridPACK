\section{Models}
Currently trying to create a definition of a bus and a branch. Also need a
definition for a measurement (it seems like measurements fall into the same
category of objects as buses and branches). We would like to encapsulate their
behavior so that modifications to power system models can be made in relatively
localized pieces of code without having to track changes through the entire code
base.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Branch Models} A branch depends on variables associated with the
branch and determines the value of off-diagonal elements in the Y-matrix. It
also contributes to values in the bus by sending buses to which it is attached a
signal (the branch invokes a bus method).

This picture makes the following assumptions (that need to be verified)
\begin{itemize}
\item branch values can be calculated without contributions from buses
\item contributions to buses are cumulative, or at least can be evaluated by
sending separate signals to the bus
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Bus Models} A bus is a container that accumulates contributions from
the branches that are connected to it as well as from parameters and state
variables associated with the bus itself. Buses evaluate contributions to the
diagonal of the Y-matrix
\item{\bf Measurement Models} measurement models contribute a row to the
H-matrix.
\begin{itemize}
\item A measurement associated with a bus can can contribute to matrix
elements connecting the state variables associated with the bus and (possibly)
state variables of branches connected to the bus
\item A measurement associated with a branch can contribute to matrix elements
connecting the state variables associated with the branch and (possibly) to
state variables of buses connected to the branch
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
