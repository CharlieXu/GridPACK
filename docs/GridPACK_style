Namespaces: all namespaces will be lower case. All GridPACK module namespaces
are subspaces of the "gridpack" namespace. It is recommended that applications
are all subspaces of this namespace as well, although this is not required.

Class names: Classes are defined with the first letter of each word capitalized.
Abreviations in the class name are also capitalize (e.g. PFBus). No underscores
are used in class names.

Class methods: function names are written with the first letter of the first
word in lower case, all other words in the function name have the first letter
capitalized (e.g. getReferenceBus). No underscores are allowed in function
names.
(Discussion: do we use all lowercase function names with underscores separating
each word?)

Enumerated types: Enumerated types are defined with the first letter capitalized
and all other letters lower case.
(Discussion: do we use all letters capitalized?)
